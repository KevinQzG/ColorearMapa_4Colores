# ColorearMapa_4Colores

Practice #3 of the data structure and algorithms 1 subject, which consists of coloring a map using the 4-color theorem, states that no more than four colors are required to color the regions of any map, such that no two adjacent regions have the same color. The step by step that the program performs are as follows:

1. Define the countries and the colors with which you are going to work
2. Assign a color to each of the countries
3. Check if a country has a border with another to avoid coloring two or more countries that are continuous with each other with the same color.
4. The previous verification is carried out through an adjacency matrix, in which 1 is used if one country has a border with another or 0 is used if the country does not have a border with the other, in this case a 13x13 matrix is used to List the countries belonging to South America.
5. Print the colored map with only 4 colors.
